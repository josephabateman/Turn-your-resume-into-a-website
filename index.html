					<h5>Session Musician/Writer</h5>
					<p>I have worked as a self-employed session musician for the past three years. My work is carried out from a home based recording studio which I designed and built for my needs. My work comes from a number of sources, including online third party websites as well as my own self made website. My work consists primarily of writing vocal top-lines (lyrics and melody) and singing. I complete all the projects using Apple’s Logic Pro X software and a range of third party plugins.</p></div>

					<h5>Specialist</h5>
					<p>Worked as a “Specialist” at the Apple retail store in the Leeds Trinity Centre - a flagship store for the UK where I assisted customers, helped troubleshoot device issues and provided general customer support. Out of a team of more than 120 employees I was regularly the top performer for multiple sales targets. In April 2015 I left this role in order to start up my home based music business and pursue other music related opportunities.</p></div>
